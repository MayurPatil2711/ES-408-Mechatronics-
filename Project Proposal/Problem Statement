The project focuses on creating a remote-controlled firefighting robot designed to improve safety and operational 
efficiency in extreme hazard environments. Traditional firefighting methods often expose personnel to significant 
risks, particularly in scenarios with high temperatures, toxic gases, or unstable structures. This robot, equipped 
with advanced sensors and cameras, can navigate dangerous areas, assess fire conditions, and deploy firefighting 
measures without direct human intervention. By remotely controlling the robot, operators can tackle fires from a safe 
distance, reducing the potential for injury and enabling more precise firefighting in challenging environments. This 
innovation aims to revolutionize emergency response in hazardous settings.
