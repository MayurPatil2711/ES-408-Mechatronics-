**Problem Statement:**

The project focuses on creating a remote-controlled firefighting robot designed to improve safety and efficiency in 
dangerous environments. By remotely navigating the robot equipped with fire suppression tools and sensors, human 
exposure to life-threatening conditions is minimized, allowing for safer, faster, and more effective fire mitigation 
in extreme hazard zones.
