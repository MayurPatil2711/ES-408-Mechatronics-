# **Short Notes on dicussion with Prof. Madhu Vadali on 21/08/2024**

* The conversation revolved around refining the problem statement and technical approach for a firefighting robot project. The primary issue is reducing the risk of injury to firefighters by developing a robot that can operate in extreme conditions.

* A strong emphasis on clearly defining the problem was identified, not just focusing on general fire hazards but specifically on protecting firefighters.

* Also highlighted the need for a detailed mechatronic architecture, including power management, control systems, and feedback loops. 

* Concerns were raised about ensuring the robotâ€™s stability, power supply, and movement control, especially when operating under varying conditions like water pressure from a hose. There was a suggestion to incorporate closed-loop control systems to maintain consistent movement regardless of external factors. The idea of using higher-power-rated motor drivers and considering potential force feedback is discussed.

* It also touched on practical steps like reading manuals, understanding components, and planning the system's design. The need for further learning about sensors and motor control is emphasized, indicating that more research and development are necessary to create a functional and effective robot.
