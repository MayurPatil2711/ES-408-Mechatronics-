# Short Notes on dicussion with Prof. Madhu Vadali on 2/9/2024

- **Project Overview**: The discussion was about developing a firefighting robot with a focus on targeting, water pressure management, and sensor integration.

- **Targeting, Aiming and Sensors**: The robot needs to be able to target a fire inside a building, potentially through smoke. For the demonstration, a simple camera might be used to simulate fire detection, but in reality, more advanced sensors could be implemented to detect fire even in smoky conditions.

- **Water Pressure and Motor Calculations**: It's important to calculate the water pressure and the force exerted on the motors, especially when water is being discharged. The motors must be strong enough to handle the pressure and maintain the robot's stability. There was an emphasis on the need to calculate the flow rate and the impact on the projectile motion of the water stream.

- **Practical Considerations**: The conversation also touched on the practical aspects of demonstrating the robot, such as using placards to simulate fire and the need for a system to manually control the robot's targeting and water discharge.

- **Next Steps**: The key tasks involve finalizing the motor specifications, ensuring the robot can handle the water pressure, and integrating the necessary sensors for fire detection and targeting. Additionally, back-calculations will be needed to determine the correct water flow rate and pressure based on the distance to the target.
